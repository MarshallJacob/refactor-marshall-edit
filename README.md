## This is my edit on the horiseon marketing page

The page when view pulled up looks great. The problem comes when you view the code. It wasn't very efficient.

### Activity purpose

I did there were a couple areas that I focused on during this challenge such as:

* Writing in notes to better identify what's happening within the code.

* Finding ways to combine classes and elements in order to shorten the code that was already written in order to be more efficient.

* Using semantics to better organize the code.

* Various other things to help with accesibility and generally organize the code.
